Assignment:
	Create (using object oriented programming) a class Student with the following attributes:
		(1) AM (int)(number for student in greek called AM) CAUTION!->this it also used like this in my implementation of the task!
		(2) Name (string)
		(3) Semester (insigned int)
		(4) Number of successfully passed subjects (unsigned int)
		(5) Array with grades for passed subjects (float*)
	The class must support creation of entries in the following ways:
		(1) By inserting only AM and Name (In this case semester should be auto-set to 1)
		(2) By inserting AM, Name and Semester (In this case the student has not yet passed a subject)
		(3) By inserting everything
		(4) By asking for everything to be copied from another student
	The class should also have getters and setters for its private attributes.
	Also the class needs to be able to do/support the following:
		(1) Insertion of new grade into the array
		(2) print student stats in one line
		(3) print student stats in detail (average grade should be included in greek called mo )
			CAUTION->this is also used like this in my code!)
			Note that no subject names are needed! Just use numbers (p.e. "subject 1")

The above are only guidelines and you should add more stuff as you see fit to make the program easier and/or faster to use.
As always my implementation is uploaded. You can find it inside the StudentEntryManipulationProgram folder. Feel free to take some ideas.
And above all, have a happy time coding!!
